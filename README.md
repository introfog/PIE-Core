# PIE
### Main
This project is a second iteration of physics rigid-body engine on Java8.

PIE consist of three modules:
* **Core** - main engine logics, such as: broad and narrow phase and collisions resolving.
* **Benchmark** - different performance tests.
* **Test** - code for organizing unit tests.

### Others

Work on the project is slow, because I do it in my free time from studies and main work.
You can track the progress in the GitHub project. 

I will be glad to any suggestions and your pull request.
